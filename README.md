# customer_repo

In this project I'll create a mysql script that creates a database with 4 tables (customer repo is the name of the database, customer, grade level, topic and processor are the names of the tables).

I'll have to create an API in java that allows me to make basic mysql queries such as inserting, updating, selecting and deleting from tables.
