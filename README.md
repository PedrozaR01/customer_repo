# customer_repo

In this project I'll create a mysql script that creates a database with 4 tables (the sql script can be found on the repository). 

I'll have to create an API in java that allows me to make basic mysql queries such as inserting, updating, selecting and deleting from tables.
The project is a Maven one and has to be run using the goal "spring-boot:run".

Using postman I tested th API, the collection can also be found on the reposiotory.
